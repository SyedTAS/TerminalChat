# TerminalChat 
TerminalChat is an Android App that is supposed to look like a Terminal , it doesn't feature accounts but has a very simple username system.
# How It Works 
Whenever you press on the "Send" button , the app sends the text in the username and message textbox to a database, as soon as the database receives info , it loads the data in the listview, this results in a functional chat environment.
